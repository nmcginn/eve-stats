# A short summary of dead black ops battleships.

### BLOPS type vs. estimated value

The first comparison I wanted to see was "which BLOPS is the most expensive to lose?". The Sin is the clear winner for #nopoors.

```{r}
dead_blops <- dead_ships %>% select(typeName, zkb.totalValue)
dead_blops %>% group_by(typeName) %>%
  summarise(avg_isk_lost = mean(zkb.totalValue), median_isk_lost = median(zkb.totalValue))
```

### Which alliance has lost the most BLOPS?

Let's take a look at the top 10!

```{r}
dead_blops <- dead_ships %>% select(typeName, victim.allianceName, zkb.totalValue)
dead_blops %>% group_by(victim.allianceName) %>%
  summarise(lost_blops = n(), avg_isk = mean(zkb.totalValue)) %>%
  filter(victim.allianceName != "") %>% arrange(desc(lost_blops))
```
